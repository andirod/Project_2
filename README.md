**OVERVIEW**

This repository contains Python code for analyzing the Titanic dataset, exploring various aspects of data preprocessing, visualization, and predictive modeling. The code is well-commented and organized into sections, making it easy to understand and replicate the analysis.

**DEPENDENCIES**:
Python 
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn



DESCRIPTIONS**:

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone on board, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

This analysis was conducted as part of a 6-Month Columbia Engineering- Artificial Intelligence Executive Program, aiming to demonstrate proficiency in data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning modeling techniques. Special thanks to the creators of the Titanic dataset and the libraries used in this analysis.

This dataset has been referred from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data.


**OBJECTIVES**:

-Understand the Dataset & cleanup (if required).

-Build a strong classification model to predict whether the passenger survives or not.

-Also fine-tune the hyperparameters & compare the evaluation metrics of various classification algorithms.


**CONTENTS:**


*Introduction*

-Overview of the Titanic dataset analysis.

-Brief description of the repository contents.



*Data Loading and Exploration*

-Loading the Titanic dataset from a CSV file.

-Initial exploration of the dataset, displaying the first few rows and checking for missing values.



*Data Preprocessing*

-Handling missing values in the Age, Embarked, and Cabin columns using appropriate imputation techniques.

-Encoding categorical variables (Sex and Embarked) using one-hot encoding to prepare the data for modeling.

-Dropping unnecessary columns (PassengerId, Name, Ticket, Cabin) from the dataset.



*Data Visualization*

-Visualizing survival counts by gender, embarked port, and passenger class using seaborn countplot.

-Interpretation of visualizations to gain insights into survival patterns among different groups of passengers.



*Modeling*

-Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets for machine learning modeling.

-Training a logistic regression model to predict passenger survival.

-Evaluating model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report metrics.

-Performing hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize the logistic regression model.

*Results*

-Summary of the model's performance before and after hyperparameter optimization.

-Detailed analysis of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for both survivor and non-survivor classes.



*How to Use*

To replicate the analysis and run the code:

-Clone the repository to your local machine.

-Ensure you have Python and necessary libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib) installed.

-Execute the Python script or Jupyter Notebook containing the code.



*Contribution Guidelines*

-Contributions to improve the analysis or add new features are welcome! If you have any suggestions, bug fixes, or enhancements, please submit a pull request or open an issue on GitHub.
